        <p>This is my dog Deisel, he is three years old and his birthday is in August. I got him on November 10th 2019. He was diagnosed with a deformed ear and thats why his left ear does not stick up to match the right. Even though his ear is deformed it does not affect his health and he is a very healthy, energetic, smart dog.</p>
